# Automation_Selenium_Projects
This repository contains Python automation projects built using Selenium WebDriver. It includes code for an Instagram follower bot, an internet speed test bot, and a LinkedIn job application automation bot. These projects demonstrate how to automate browser interactions, bypass basic bot detection mechanisms, and perform efficient web data extraction and task automation.
